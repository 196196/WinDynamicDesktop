Submit your bug report or feature request here. If you have questions please ask them on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/t1m0thyj/WinDynamicDesktop) instead.

When reporting a bug please provide:
 - Steps to reproduce it
 - Screenshots (if applicable)
 - Log file (if it exists, see below for how to find it)
 - Windows version (e.g. 7, 10)
 - WinDynamicDesktop version (e.g. 2.0.0)
 - Installation source (e.g. installer, Microsoft Store, portable EXE)

**Attaching log file**

If WinDynamicDesktop crashes, it should log the error info to a file `WinDynamicDesktop.exe.log` in the same folder as the app EXE. If you're not sure what folder to look in, that depends on how you installed the app:
 - Desktop version - The folder that you chose during the installation process (default location is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\WinDynamicDesktop`)
 - Microsoft Store app - The folder where the app package is located (likely `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\38719TimothyJohnson.WinDynamicDesktop_rfarkse4rn21a\LocalState`)
